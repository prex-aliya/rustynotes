Rusty notes will be a application that helps you keep a to-do list while making
an easy way for you to keep track of where you found your knowledge and how to
get back to it, a homemade wiki.

Currently, it is just a to-do list.

Currently Linux is the only supported platform, but there are plans for
extending our reach.

To run use the command:

```console
    cargo run TODO
```

Withing the projects directory

For installation on other platforms a rust dev environment is needed and not
currently test.
